{"lyrics": "There ain't no gold in this river\r\nThat I've been washin' my hands in forever\r\nI know there is hope in these waters\r\nBut I can't bring myself to swim\r\nWhen I am drownin' in the silence\r\nBaby, let me in\n\n\n\nGo easy on me, baby\n\nI was still a child\n\nDidn't get the chance to\n\nFeel the world around me\n\nI had no time to choose what I chose to do\n\nSo go easy on me\n\n\n\nThere ain't no room for our things to change\n\nWhen we are both so deeply stuck in our ways\n\nYou can't deny how hard I've tried\n\nI changed who I was to put you both first\n\nBut now I give up\n\n\n\nGo \u0435asy on me, baby\n\nI was still a child\n\nDidn't get the chanc\u0435 to\n\nFeel the world around me\n\nHad no time to choose what I chose to do\n\nSo go easy on me\n\n\n\nI had good intentions\n\nAnd the highest hopes\n\nBut I know right now\n\nIt probably doesn't even show\n\n\n\nGo easy on me, baby\n\nI was still a child\n\nI didn't get the chance to\n\nFeel the world around me\n\nI had no time to choose what I chose to do\n\nSo go easy on me", "timestamp": 1763937247.448609}
