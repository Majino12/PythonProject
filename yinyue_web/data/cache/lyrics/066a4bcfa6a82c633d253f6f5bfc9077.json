{"lyrics": "Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you\r\nHoldin' me back\r\nGravity's holdin' me back\r\nI want you to hold out the palm of your hand\r\nWhy don't we leave it at that?\n\nNothin' to say\n\nAnd everything gets in the way\n\nSeems you cannot be replaced\n\nAnd I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh\n\n\n\nIn this world, it's just us\n\nYou know it's not the same as it was\n\nIn this world, it's just us\n\nYou know it's not the same as it was\n\nAs it was, as it was\n\nYou know it's not the same\n\n\n\nAnswer the phone\n\n\"Harry, you're no good alone\n\nWhy are you sitting at home on the floor?\n\nWhat kind of pills are you on?\"\n\nRingin' the bell\n\nAnd nobody's coming to help\n\nYour daddy lives by himself\n\nHe just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh\n\n\n\nIn this world, it's just us\n\nYou know it's not the same as it was\n\nIn this world, it's just us\n\nYou know it's not the same as it was\n\nAs it was, as it was\n\nYou know it's not the same\n\n\n\nGo home, get ahead, light-speed internet\n\nI don't wanna talk about the way that it was\n\nLeave America, two kids follow her\n\nI don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first\n\n\n\n(Hey)\n\nAs it was\n\nYou know it's not the same as it was\n\nAs it was, as it was", "timestamp": 1763937245.9396539}
