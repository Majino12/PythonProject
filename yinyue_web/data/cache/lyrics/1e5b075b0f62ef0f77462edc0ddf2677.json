{"lyrics": "First things first\r\nI'm say all the words inside my head\r\nI'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh\r\nThe way that things have been, oh-ooh\r\nSecond thing second\r\nDon't you tell me what you think that I can be\n\nI'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh\n\nThe master of my sea, oh-ooh\n\n\n\nI was broken from a young age\n\nTaking my sulkin to the masses\n\nWrite down my poems for the few\n\nThat looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me\n\nSinging from heart ache from the pain\n\nTake up my message from the veins\n\nSpeaking my lesson from the brain\n\nSeeing the beauty through the...\n\n\n\nPain!\n\nYou made me a, you made me a believer, believer\n\nPain!\n\nYou break me down, you build me up, believer, believer\n\nPain!\n\nI let the bullets fly, oh let them rain\n\nMy life, my love, my drive, it came from...\n\nPain!\n\nYou made me a, you made me a believer, believer\n\n\n\nThird things third\n\nSend a prayer to the ones up above\n\nAll the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh\n\nYour spirit up above, oh-ooh\n\n\n\nI was choking in the crowd\n\nLiving my brain up in the cloud\n\nFalling like ashes to the ground\n\nHoping my feelings, they would drown\n\nBut they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing\n\nInhibited, limited\n\nTill it broke up and it rained down\n\nIt rained down, like...\n\n\n\nPain!\n\nYou made me a, you made me a believer, believer\n\nPain!\n\nYou break me down, you build me up, believer, believer\n\nPain!\n\nI let the bullets fly, oh let them rain\n\nMy life, my love, my drive, they came from...\n\nPain!\n\nYou made me a, you made me a believer, believer\n\n\n\nLast things last\n\nBy the grace of the fire and the flames\n\nYou're the face of the future, you're the blood in my veins, oh-ooh\n\nThe blood in my veins, oh-ooh\n\nBut they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing\n\nInhibited, limited\n\nTill it broke up and it rained down\n\nIt rained down, like...\n\n\n\nPain!\n\nYou made me a, you made me a believer, believer\n\nPain!\n\nYou break me down, you build me up, believer, believer\n\nPain!\n\nI let the bullets fly, oh let them rain\n\nMy life, my love, my drive, they came from...\n\nPain!\n\nYou made me a, you made me a believer, believer", "timestamp": 1763937272.3352902}
