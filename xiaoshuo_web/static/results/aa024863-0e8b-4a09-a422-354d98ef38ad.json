He flattered himself that she would find in it the satisfaction of the luxurious desires which he attributed to her, the joy of making a display of grandeur, the vulgar pride, the material domination, which were for him all the value of life, as he had no ideas on the subject of the happiness of a true woman, although he was sure that his daughter would remain virtuous. She liked to see the stony landscape which the clearness of the air made distinct; to walk quickly and firmly on the quay where the trees displayed the black tracery of their branches on the horizon reddened by the smoke of the city; to look at the Seine. And when the moon rose on the fields of olive-trees, seeing the soft lines of plains and of hills pass, Therese, in this landscape wherein everything spoke of peace and oblivion, and nothing spoke of her, regretted the Seine, the Arc de Triomphe with its radiating avenues, and the alleys of the park where, at least, the trees and the stones knew her. There were big bronze bells marked with the Florentine lily; bells of the Renaissance, representing a lady wearing a white gown; bells of the dead, decorated with tears and bones; bells covered with symbolical animals and leaves, which had rung in the churches in the time of St. Louis; table-bells of the seventeenth century, having a statuette for a handle; the flat, clear cow-bells of the Ruth Valley; Hindu bells; Chinese bells formed like cylinders — they had come from all countries and all times, at the magic call of little Miss Bell.", "chapter_summaries": [{"chapter_number": 1, "summary": "He was born in Paris, April 16, 1844, the son of a bookseller of the Quai Malaquais, in the shadow of the Institute.

Count Martin, in the face of the imperial centrepiece and of the winged Victorys, talked suitably of Napoleon as an organizer and administrator, and placed him in a high position as president of the state council, where his words threw light upon obscure questions. He lived from the outside.” Garain, who did not like Paul Vence’s ingenious turn of wit and language, tried to hasten the conclusion: “In a word,” he said, “there was something of the monster in the man.” “There are no monsters,” replied Paul Vence; “and men who pass for monsters inspire horror.", "word_count": 4326, "length": 24975}, {"chapter_number": 5, "summary": "With her left arm she raised the portiere, placed her right hand on the key of the door; and, standing against the rich background of the sapphire and ruby-colored folds of the Oriental draperies, she turned her head toward the friend she was leaving, and said, a little mockingly, yet with a touch of tragic emotion: “Good-by, Robert. Yet she felt that she was under the mysterious spell of the friendship of inanimate things; and it seemed to her that the stones, the doors of houses, the lights behind the windowpanes, looked kindly upon her.

It seemed to her that the pretty woman, who, among the warm shadows of a closed room, placed her bare feet in the fur of the brown bear rug, and to whom her lover gave kisses while she twisted her hair in front of a glass, was not herself, was not even a woman that she knew well, or that she desired to know, but a person whose affairs were of no interest to her. Now she finds it more practical to live with her managers, and Jacques finds it more agreeable to travel.” “Does he regret her?” “How can one know the things that agitate a mind anxious and mobile, selfish and passionate, desirous to surrender itself, prompt in disengaging itself, liking itself most of all among the beautiful things that it finds in the world?” Brusquely she changed the subject.", "word_count": 3486, "length": 19354}, {"chapter_number": 7, "summary": "But that her desire to go should contain a vague joy, that she should feel the charm of what she was to find, was inexplicable to her.

All his ills came to attack him at once: the humidity in the air gave him a pain in the knee, and he could not bend his leg; his carpet-bag, lost the day before in the trip from the station to Fiesole, had not been found, and it was an irreparable disaster; a Paris review had just published one of his poems, with typographical errors as glaring as Aphrodite’s shell.", "word_count": 1365, "length": 7600}]}, "character_analysis": {"main_characters": [{"name": "Martin", "total_mentions": 27, "first_appearance": 1}, {"name": "Paul Vence", "total_mentions": 23, "first_appearance": 1}, {"name": "Montessuy", "total_mentions": 8, "first_appearance": 1}, {"name": "Seniavine", "total_mentions": 5, "first_appearance": 1}, {"name": "Le Menil", "total_mentions": 4, "first_appearance": 1}, {"name": "Martin-Belleme", "total_mentions": 4, "first_appearance": 1}, {"name": "M.
