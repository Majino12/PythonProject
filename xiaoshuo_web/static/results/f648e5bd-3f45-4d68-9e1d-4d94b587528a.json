It is customary for the leader of the opposition on such occasions to express his opinion in the most courteous language, that his right honourable friend, sitting opposite to him on the Treasury bench, has been, is, and will be wrong in everything that he thinks, says, or does in public life; but that, as anything like factious opposition is never adopted on that side of the House, the Address to the Queen, in answer to that most fatuous speech which has been put into Her Majesty’s gracious mouth, shall be allowed to pass unquestioned. That further portion of it in which he explained with blandest, most beneficent, honey-flowing words that his party would have done everything that the country could require of any party, had the House allowed it to remain on the Treasury benches for a month or two — and explained also that his party would never recriminate, would never return evil for evil, would in no wise copy the factious opposition of their adversaries; that his party would now, as it ever had done, carry itself with the meekness of the dove, and the wisdom of the serpent — all this, I say, was so generally felt by gentlemen on both sides of the House to be “leather and prunella”, that very little attention was paid to it. I like a fast man, but I know that I must not dare to marry the sort of man that I like.” “To be one of us, then — the very first among us — would that be the wrong side?” “You mean that to be Lady Chiltern in the present tense, and Lady Brentford in the future, would be promotion for Violet Effingham in the past?” “How hard you are, Violet!” “Fancy — that it should come to this — that you should call me hard, Laura.", "chapter_summaries": [{"chapter_number": 1, "summary": "His father, whose religion was not of that bitter kind in which we in England are apt to suppose that all the Irish Roman Catholics indulge, had sent his son to Trinity; and there were some in the neighbourhood of Killaloe — patients, probably, of Dr Duggin, of Castle Connell, a learned physician who had spent a fruitless life in endeavouring to make head against Dr Finn — who declared that old Finn would not be sorry if his son were to turn Protestant and go in for a fellowship. The doctor so far gave way, under the influence of Phineas himself, and of all the young women of the family, as to pay the usual fee to a very competent and learned gentleman in the Middle Temple, and to allow his son one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for three years. It was in vain that the doctor tried to explain that going into Parliament could not help a young barrister, whatever it might do for one thoroughly established in his profession; that Phineas, if successful at Loughshane, would at once abandon all idea of earning any income — that the proposition, coming from so poor a man, was a monstrosity — that such an opposition to the Morris family, coming from a son of his, would be gross ingratitude to Lord Tulla.", "word_count": 4338, "length": 23279}, {"chapter_number": 2, "summary": "I suppose he had better come and see me.” The doctor promised that his son should ride over to Castlemorris, and then took his leave — not specially flattered, as he felt that were his son to be returned, the Earl would not regard him as the one gentleman among ten whom the county might send to leaven the remainder of its members — but aware that the greatest impediment in his son’s way was already removed. He thought that debates were good, because of the people outside — because they served to create that public opinion which was hereafter to be used in creating some future House of Commons; but he did not think it possible that any vote should be given on a great question, either this way or that, as the result of a debate; and he was certainly assured in his own opinion that any such changing of votes would be dangerous, revolutionary, and almost unparliamentary. “I tell you it won’t, my dear; he is so good and so true.” “I know he is good, Barbara; and as for truth, there is no question about it, because he has never said a word to me that he might not say to any girl.” “That’s nonsense, Mary.” “He never has, then, as sure as the blessed Virgin watches over us — only you don’t believe she does.” “Never mind about the Virgin now Mary.” “But he never has.", "word_count": 3767, "length": 20118}, {"chapter_number": 3, "summary": "And he was a man altogether different from the O’B— s, O’C— s, and O’D— s. Laurence Fitzgibbon could always get the ear of the House if he chose to speak, and his friends declared that he might have been high up in office long since if he would have taken the trouble to work. “Well, Finn, my boy,” said Laurence, shaking hands with the young member on board the steamer, “so you’ve made it all right at Loughshane.” Then Phineas was beginning to tell all the story, the wonderful story, of George Morris and the Earl of Tulla — how the men of Loughshane had elected him without opposition; how he had been supported by Conservatives as well as Liberals — how unanimous Loughshane had been in electing him, Phineas Finn, as its representative. He found himself constantly regretting that he was there; and as constantly telling himself that he, hardly yet twenty-five, without a shilling of his own, had achieved an entrance into that assembly which by the consent of all men is the greatest in the world, and which many of the rich magnates of the country had in vain spent heaps of treasure in their endeavours to open to their own footsteps.", "word_count": 2695, "length": 14563}, {"chapter_number": 4, "summary": "He was not unwilling that it should be so; for though, as he had repeatedly told himself, he was by no means in love with Lady Laura — who was, as he imagined, somewhat older than himself — nevertheless, he would feel gratified at accepting anything from her hands, and he felt a keen desire for some increase to those ties of friendship which bound them together. The Countess had been long dead; and Lady Emily, the younger daughter, who had been the great beauty of her day, was now the wife of a Russian nobleman whom she had persisted in preferring to any of her English suitors, and lived at St Petersburg. She never straggled when she stood or walked; but she would lean forward when sitting, as a man does, and would use her arms in talking, and would put her hand over her face, and pass her fingers through her hair — after the fashion of men rather than of women — and she seemed to despise that soft quiescence of her sex in which are generally found so many charms.", "word_count": 2268, "length": 11953}, {"chapter_number": 5, "summary": "It was true that he could not hold even a Treasury lordship with a poor thousand a year for his salary without having to face the electors of Loughshane again before he entered upon the enjoyment of his place — but if he could only do something to give a grace to his name, to show that he was a rising man, the electors of Loughshane, who had once been so easy with him, would surely not be cruel to him when he showed himself a second time among them. The late President of the Council, the Duke of St Bungay, and Lord Brentford had married sisters, and the St Bungay people, and the Mildmay people, and the Brentford people had all some sort of connection with the Palliser people, of whom the heir and coming chief, Plantagenet Palliser, would certainly be Chancellor of the Exchequer in the next Government. “You have made up your mind, then, that I mean to be idle?” “I have made up my mind that your time will be wholly unprofitable — if you do as you say you intend to do.” “But you do not know my plan; just listen to me.” Then Mr Low did listen, and Phineas explained his plan — saying, of course, nothing of his love for Lady Laura, but giving Mr Low to understand that he intended to assist in turning out the existing Government and to mount up to some seat — a humble seat at first — on the Treasury bench, by the help of his exalted friends and by the use of his own gifts of eloquence.", "word_count": 4243, "length": 22486}, {"chapter_number": 6, "summary": "It is customary for the leader of the opposition on such occasions to express his opinion in the most courteous language, that his right honourable friend, sitting opposite to him on the Treasury bench, has been, is, and will be wrong in everything that he thinks, says, or does in public life; but that, as anything like factious opposition is never adopted on that side of the House, the Address to the Queen, in answer to that most fatuous speech which has been put into Her Majesty’s gracious mouth, shall be allowed to pass unquestioned. “I conceive it to be my duty,” Mr Mildmay had said, “at once to assume that the country is unwilling that the right honourable gentlemen opposite should keep their seats on the bench upon which they sit, and in the performance of that duty I am called upon to divide the House upon the Address to Her Majesty.” And if Mr Mildmay used strong language, the reader may be sure that Mr Mildmay’s followers used language much stronger. He’s not quick, you know, as you are, and he has no enthusiasm on any subject — but he has opinions, and sound opinions too.” Phineas felt that Lady Laura was in a slight degree scolding him for the disrespectful manner in which he had spoken of Mr Kennedy; and he felt also that he had committed himself — that he had shown himself to be sore, and that she had seen and understood his soreness.", "word_count": 4249, "length": 22536}, {"chapter_number": 7, "summary": "But he is weak and blind, and flies like a moth to the candle; one pities the poor moth, and would save him a stump of his wing if it be possible.” Phineas, when he had written his letter to Mr Low, started off for Lincoln’s Inn, making his way through the well-known dreary streets of Soho, and through St Giles’s, to Long Acre. He had conceived a liking for the route, which he might easily have changed without much addition to the distance, by passing through Oxford Street and Holborn; but there was an air of business on which he prided himself in going by the most direct passage, and he declared to himself very often that things dreary and dingy to the eye might be good in themselves. I can’t conceive it possible to find a worse Prime Minister than either of the three — but the country affords no other.” “And which would Mildmay name?” “All of them — one after the other, so as to make the embarrassment the greater.” That was Mr Fitzgibbon’s description of the crisis; but then it was understood that Mr Fitzgibbon was given to romancing.", "word_count": 4403, "length": 23249}, {"chapter_number": 8, "summary": "And now I take the liberty — for it is a liberty — ” “Oh no.” “Because I feel so anxious that you should do nothing to mar your chances as a rising man.” “You are only too kind to me — always.” “I know how clever you are, and how excellent are all your instincts; but I see that you are a little impetuous. “And therefore,” continued Lady Laura, “I talk to you as though I were a kind of grandmother.” “You shall be my great-grandmother if you will only be kind enough to me to say what you really think.” “You must not then be so impetuous, and you must be a little more careful to be civil to persons to whom you may not take any particular fancy. You do not mean to conquer the world all by yourself.” “No — but there is something mean to me in the expressed idea that I should make use of any man — and more especially of a man whom I don’t like.” “And why do you not like him, Mr Finn?” “Because he is one of my Dr Fells.” “You don’t like him simply because he does not talk much.", "word_count": 3735, "length": 19275}, {"chapter_number": 9, "summary": "That further portion of it in which he explained with blandest, most beneficent, honey-flowing words that his party would have done everything that the country could require of any party, had the House allowed it to remain on the Treasury benches for a month or two — and explained also that his party would never recriminate, would never return evil for evil, would in no wise copy the factious opposition of their adversaries; that his party would now, as it ever had done, carry itself with the meekness of the dove, and the wisdom of the serpent — all this, I say, was so generally felt by gentlemen on both sides of the House to be “leather and prunella”, that very little attention was paid to it. Mr Gresham was willing to serve with Mr Mildmay — with certain stipulations as to the special seat in the Cabinet which he himself was to occupy, and as to the introduction of certain friends of his own; but — so said these gentlemen who were supposed really to understand the matter — Mr Gresham was not willing to serve with the Duke and with Mr Palliser. Robert Kennedy for ever and ever.” Phineas when he said this did not as yet know exactly how it would have come to pass that such honour — the honour of the enduring prefix to his name — would have come in the way of Mr Kennedy had Mr Kennedy accepted the office in question; but he was very quick to learn all these things, and, in the meantime, he rarely made any mistake about them.", "word_count": 2929, "length": 15938}, {"chapter_number": 10, "summary": "I like a fast man, but I know that I must not dare to marry the sort of man that I like.” “To be one of us, then — the very first among us — would that be the wrong side?” “You mean that to be Lady Chiltern in the present tense, and Lady Brentford in the future, would be promotion for Violet Effingham in the past?” “How hard you are, Violet!” “Fancy — that it should come to this — that you should call me hard, Laura. But a woman has to mind herself — and very hard work it is when she has a dragon of her own driving her ever the wrong way.” “I want to take you from the dragon.” “Yes — and to hand me over to a griffin.” “The truth is, Violet, that you do not know Oswald. And as I always find her sayings to be untrue, I suppose this is like the rest of them.” “It is untrue if it be said of him as a habit.” “It is another paroxysm, just now and then.” “Do not laugh at me, Violet, when I am taking his part, or I shall be offended.” “But you see, if I am to be his wife, it is — rather important.” “Still you need not ridicule me.” “Dear Laura, you know I do not
